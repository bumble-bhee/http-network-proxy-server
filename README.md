# HTTP Network Proxy Server

## Project Overview
This project implements a custom HTTP Network Proxy Server using C++. The proxy server works as an intermediary between client applications and web servers. It receives HTTP requests from clients, forwards them to the target servers, and relays the responses back to the clients. The project demonstrates practical implementation of core networking concepts such as socket programming, multithreading, and HTTP request handling.

## Features
- HTTP request and response forwarding
- Thread-per-connection concurrency model
- Domain-based blocking using a configuration file
- Logging of client requests and proxy activity
- Handles multiple simultaneous client connections
- Runs completely on local machine (no hosting required)

## Technologies Used
- C++
- POSIX Socket Programming
- Multithreading using std::thread
- Linux environment

## Project Structure
```
src/        - Source code files  
config/     - Configuration files (blocked domains list)  
logs/       - Log files generated by the proxy  
docs/       - Design and demo documentation  
Makefile    - Build configuration file  
```

## Build Instructions
Navigate to the project root directory and run:

```bash
make clean
make
```

## Running the Proxy Server
Start the proxy server using:

```bash
./proxy
```

The proxy server listens on port **8888** by default.

## Testing the Proxy Server
You can test the proxy server using the following curl command:

```bash
curl -x localhost:8888 http://example.com
```

## Domain Blocking
To block domains, add them line-by-line in the following file:

```
config/blocked_domains.txt
```

Requests to blocked domains will be denied by the proxy server.

## Logging
All proxy activity is logged in the following file:

```
logs/proxy.log
```

## Demo Video
A 2–3 minute demo video explaining the project and demonstrating the working proxy server is available here:
